  bio: "John John Florence is one of only five surfers in Mens Championship Tour history to clinch his first two World Titles in back-to-back fashion. Mark Richards, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, and the late Andy Irons are the only other members of that elite club. The mild-mannered prodigy from the North Shore of Oahu has been living in the publics eye since the age of eight when he first paddled out at Pipeline, his backyard break that just happens to be the most famous wave in the world. By 12 hed mastered a wide variety of ocean conditions and his breadth of ocean knowledge was compounded by the nurturing of North Shore sages, giving Florence all the evolutionary tools needed to become the best surfer in the world. His deep love of sailing is only enhancing his ocean knowledge, and his film projects are an ever-expanding creative side hustle. In 2020 he plugged the one glaring hole in his CV by winning the Billabong Pipe Masters crown, held in his front yard.",
